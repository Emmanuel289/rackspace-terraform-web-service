# rackspace-terraform-web-service
This repository contains my submission for Approach 1. The implementation launches a simple website in AWS using Terraform configuration files and a bash script.
# Setup

- Clone the repository https://github.com/Emmanuel289/rackspace-terraform-web-service.git.
- Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory. Run the following commands and enter "yes" to approve the actions after confirming the deployment plan:
```
terraform init   #  Updates the terraform modules and required providers
terraform plan  #   Optional: run 'terraform plan -out <design.plan>' to save the deployment plan to an output file named <design.plan>
terraform apply #   Apply the actions in the plan
```

# Components

- The ``` vpc.tf``` file defines a VPC that is deployed in the Canada (Central) region. The 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR block is reserved for the VPC.
- The VPC spans 3 availability zones and comprises 3 /24 public subnets and 3 /24 private subnets.
- A pair of public and private subnets live in an availability zone with one NAT gateway per public subnet.
-  The ```elb-asg.tf ``` file defines an autoscaling group with a launch template for EC2 instances. Scaling policies are implemented to resize the number of instances according to a cpu utilization threshold of 75 %.
-  The ```elb-asg.tf``` file also defines an elastic load balancer that is used to register    instances and perform health checks.
-  A security group that allows HTTP traffic to the load balancer from anywhere (not directly to the instance(s)) and a security group that allows only HTTP traffic from the load balancer to the instances(s) are configured in ```sec-grps.tf```.
- ```install_apache.sh``` automatically installs an Apache web server in an EC2 instance when it comes into service.
- The ```variables.tf```file contains variable declarations that are used across multiple resources and ```outputs.tf``` file contains exported variables that are useful for debugging.
- The files matching the ```.terraform``` pattern are generated by Terraform after running ```terraform init``` to store state data and lock files for actions.
