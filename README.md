# rackspace-terraform-web-service
This repository contains a solution for launching a simple website in AWS
using Terraform configuration files and a bash script.
# Setup

- Clone the repository https://github.com/Emmanuel289/rackspace-terraform-web-service.git.
- Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory. Run the following commands and enter "yes" to approve the actions after confirming the deployment plan.
```
terraform init   #  Updates the terraform modules and required providers
terraform plan  # Optional: run terraform plan -out <design.plan> to save the deployment plan to an output file named <design-plan>
terraform apply # Apply the actions in the plan
```

# Components

- The ``` vpc.tf``` file defines a VPC that is deployed in the Canada (Central) region. The VPC is allocated with the 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR block.
- The VPC spans 3 availability zones and comprises 3 /24 public subnets and 3 /24 private subnets.
- A pair of public and private subnets live in an availability zone with one NAT gateway per public subnet.
-  The ```elb-asg.tf ``` file defines an autoscaling group with a launch template for EC2 instances. Scaling policies are implemented to resize the number of instances according to a cpu utilization threshold of 75 %.
-  The ```elb-asg.tf``` file also defines an elastic load balancer that is used to register    instances within the autoscaling group.
- Security groups are defined in ```sec-grps.tf```. A security group that allows HTTP traffic to the load balancer from anywhere (not directly to the instance(s)) and a security group that allows only HTTP traffic from the load balancer to the instances(s) are configured.
- ```install_apache.sh``` installs an apache web server on an EC2 instance when it comes into service.
- The ```variables.tf``` contains variable declarations that are used across multiple resources and ```outputs.tf``` contains exported variables that are useful for debugging.
- The files matching the ```.terraform``` pattern are generated by Terraform during runtime to capture state, design plan, and management tasks.
